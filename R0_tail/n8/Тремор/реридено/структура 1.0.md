R value
R refers to the reliability of the sample. Samples with high R values produce simple, predictable results. Samples with low R values risk physical changes, or simply give wildly varying types of powers.
According to Doctor Mother, an R score of 5 indicates a 3-4% chance of unwanted physical changes, and a 0.5% chance of extreme mutations. It also indicates that the sample provides a broad category of powers, rather than a single specific power.[10]
