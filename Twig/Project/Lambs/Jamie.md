[[Jamie]], like me, still embraced the awkwardness of youth, in frame and face, but he had height.  He’d quietly embraced his own style, with the long blond hair and the glasses, the book forever in his arms, drawing up subtle walls between him and the world, while his eyes peered past, taking everything in. - много помнит, медленно реагирует, 
	медленно разгоняется после сна.
	Even on the best of days, Jamie was something of an odd bird.
 The[[ glasses]], the book he carted around with him, and the longer, [[dirty-blond hair]], currently tied back into a [[sailor’s ponytail]], they added up to a strange picture.
 He had a way of looking uncomfortable in any clothes he wore, as if they were someone else’s and he was just borrowing them.
 He tended to be quieter than the others, with Helen excepted in most situations.
 He was probably the worst of us when it came to a fight, myself excepted, and the [[slowest]] of us to react when it came to a non-fight crisis.

With all those things put together, he should have and could have been a shadow of a person, the low man on the totem pole, the gawky, awkward one, the bookworm.
 But he walked and spoke with [[confidence]].
 His [[book]] was inside a waterproof backpack, slung over one shoulder, and he spoke without looking at me, [[eyes roving over the surroundings]].
