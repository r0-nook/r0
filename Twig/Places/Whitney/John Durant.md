“John Durant.
 He got removed from the Academy when he helped make a superweapon, but failed to leash it right.
 People got killed.
 There are very few people I can think of who are as volatile as he is.
 Angry, works on projects bigger than he can handle.
 He could be as dangerous to their side as he might be to ours.”
