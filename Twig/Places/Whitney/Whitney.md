Whitney was an important location on a few fronts.
 The location was the first one, and one so obvious that it was known to anyone who had looked at a map of the area.
 It sat in a [[mountain pass]], and it remained the closest location to Westmore that the Academy didn’t have control over.
 Even for the Academy, it wasn’t cost effective to push through an area with limited mobility, ground too hard to dig trenches in.

The Academy had been divided on how important the little town of Whitney was.
 Hayle had been among the contingent that had believed Whitney [[held value]], and had volunteered us.
