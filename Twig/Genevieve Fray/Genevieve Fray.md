“I think this is the side of you that acts smart, planning, smiling and acting nice, handling all of the day to day tasks.
 But unless the head you stole away with ended up being very nasty, I think there’s a bloodthirsty part of Genevieve Fray you’re only barely holding back, a dangerous, barbaric side.”
 “Fray is [[Lady Claire]]’s tutor,”
  She’s indirect.
She just revealed the big plan to us, she did it for a reason.
She doesn’t do the ‘direct attack’ thing.”
Genevieve Fray is putting up a front, one that she buys into, at least a little.
 That she’s doing the right thing, that she’s being fair, and being nice.
 Anyone that gets in her way is the bad guy.
 If and when she runs into trouble or if the plans fall through, or if push comes to shove, she gets to feel justified because she played fair, she was honest, and the bad guys were the ones who crossed the line.
 That idea is worth more than whatever ground she might gain by outright lying.”
